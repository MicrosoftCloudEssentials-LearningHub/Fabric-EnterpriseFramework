> `Dashboard` in Microsoft Fabric is a `visual and interactive canvas` that brings together insights from various data sources into a single,
> unified view. It allows users to pin visuals from reports, monitor key metrics in real time, and interact with data through filters and slicers.
> Dashboards are ideal for `executive overviews, operational monitoring, and decision-making`, offering a high-level summary with the ability to drill down into detailed reports when needed.
