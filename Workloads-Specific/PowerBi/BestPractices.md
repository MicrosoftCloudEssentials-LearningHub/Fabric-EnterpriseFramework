## Clear Dashboard and Report Structure

> Ensure that your Power BI dashboards and reports are organized, visually cohesive, and provide clear insights at a glance.

| **Best Practice**                    | **Description**    |         **Example**        |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consistent Naming Conventions**    | Use clear and descriptive names for reports, pages, visuals, measures, and datasets.                 | Instead of generic names like `Report1`, prefer descriptive names such as `SalesPerformanceReport`. |
| **Modular Report Design**            | Organize your reports by separating key performance indicators (KPIs), detailed analysis, and context.  | Design separate pages for overviews, analytics details, and contextual information as your audience drills down. |
| **Visual Consistency**               | Apply a uniform theme and layout using Power BI themes to maintain brand consistency and readability. | Follow [Tips for designing a great Power BI dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards-design-tips) for layout and visual emphasis best practices.  |
| **Annotations and Tooltips**         | Document complex visual logic and calculations via in-report annotations and dynamic tooltips.       | Include tooltips that explain data sources or DAX logic to enhance report understandability. |

### Example Report Layout

> **Report**: SalesPerformanceReport

1. **Data Model**: Use a star schema to separate fact tables from dimension tables for clarity and efficiency.  
2. **DAX Measures**: Implement clear DAX measures with inline comments to describe the underlying logic.  
3. **Visualizations**: Combine various visuals (charts, tables, slicers) to provide interactive data insights.  
4. **Dashboard Overview**: Summarize key metrics and trends on a dedicated overview page.

## Parameterization and Dynamic Content

> Enhance report flexibility by using parameters and dynamic expressions.

| **Best Practice** | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power Query Parameters**             | Use parameters to dynamically adjust data sources and filter conditions during data ingestion.         | Define date range parameters in Power Query to allow reports to automatically update based on user configurations. |
| **Dynamic DAX Expressions**            | Create DAX measures that change in response to slicer selections or other user inputs.                   | Implement dynamic calculations using variables in DAX so that measures (like Year-over-Year growth) adjust automatically per user selection.             |
| **Dynamic Drill-throughs**             | Build drill-through URLs and links dynamically for a seamless navigation experience.                  | Concatenate strings and field values in DAX to direct users to detailed reports or external dashboards. |

## Incremental Data Refresh

> Optimize your data refresh process by updating only the data that has changed.

| **Best Practice**                      | **Description** |       **Example**      |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enable Incremental Refresh**         | Set up incremental refresh policies to refresh only new or modified data, reducing load time and resource usage.                        | Use the [Data refresh in Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-data) guidelines to configure incremental refresh for large datasets.                   |
| **Data Partitioning**                  | Partition your data by logical segments (e.g., date ranges) to target refresh operations more efficiently.                                   | Partition sales or transaction data by month or quarter so that only the most recent partitions are refreshed during scheduled updates. |

## Data Modeling and DAX Optimization

> Build robust data models and optimize DAX calculations to ensure high performance and maintainability.

| **Best Practice**                    | **Description**                                                                                         | **Example**|
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Star Schema Implementation**       | Structure your data using a star schema to improve clarity and query performance.| Separate fact tables (e.g., Sales) from dimension tables (e.g., Date, Customer) as recommended by [Power BI guidance documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/). |
| **Efficient DAX Coding**             | Utilize variables and avoid deeply nested functions to streamline DAX calculations.| Replace nested CALCULATE functions with variables: <br/><code>VAR TotalSales = SUM('Sales'[Amount]) RETURN TotalSales</code> to simplify logic and improve performance.       |
| **Reduce Cardinality When Possible** | Pre-aggregate data where applicable to reduce the detail in fact tables and improve efficiency.              | Aggregate detailed transaction logs to daily totals if high granularity is not necessary, as covered in the [Optimization guide for Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/power-bi-optimization).      |

## Security and Governance

> Safeguard data by implementing robust security measures and managing data access appropriately.

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

| **Best Practice**                     | **Description**| **Example**|
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Define RLS in Power BI Desktop**     | Use Power BI Desktop to create roles and restrict data at the row level. | Implement RLS by defining roles such as `SalesManager` and applying DAX filters (e.g., `[Region] = USERPRINCIPALNAME()`) as described in [Row-level security (RLS) guidance in Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/rls-guidance).  |
| **Test RLS Thoroughly**                | Validate security settings using the “View as Role” feature before publishing your reports. | Verify RLS filters by simulating different user roles to ensure users can only view allowed data. |
| **Optimize RLS Implementation**        | Apply RLS filters preferably on dimension tables so that filtering propagates efficiently through relationships. | Structure RLS so that filters on the Customer or Region tables automatically restrict the related fact table data. |

## Source Control and Collaboration

> Leverage version control systems and collaborative workspaces for efficient report deployment and teamwork.

| **Best Practice** | **Description** | **Example** |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
