## Granting App Audience in Fabric

> When you create and publish an app in Power BI within Fabric, you can define multiple audiences for the app. This allows you to control who can view specific content within the app.

Granting app audience permissions enables the assigned identity to:

- View the app content, including dashboards and reports.
- Interact with the app, such as filtering and highlighting data.
- Access different content based on the audience group they belong to.
