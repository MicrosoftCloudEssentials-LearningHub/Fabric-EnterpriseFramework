## How to Manage Cloud connections

Managing cloud connections in Power BI, below you can find differences between personal and shareable cloud connections:

> [!NOTE]
> `When you publish a .PBIX file` from Power BI Desktop that connects to a cloud data source, `Power BI automatically creates a personal cloud connection and binds it to your semantic model`. This means that the connection details and credentials you used in Power BI Desktop are carried over to the Power BI service, allowing the report to continue accessing the cloud data source without any additional configuration.

> Personal Cloud Connections

| **Aspect**                | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automatic Creation**    | When you publish a .PBIX file from Power BI Desktop that connects to a cloud data source, a personal cloud connection is automatically created and bound to your semantic model. This means the connection details and credentials used in Power BI Desktop are carried over to the Power BI service, allowing the report to continue accessing the cloud data source without additional configuration. |
| **Limitations**           | Personal cloud connections are tied to the individual user who created them and cannot be shared with others. This can be limiting if multiple users need to access the same data source.                                                                            |

> Shareable Cloud Connections

| **Aspect**                | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Advantages**            | Shareable cloud connections allow multiple connections to the same data source with different settings and can be shared with other users. This makes data management more collaborative and flexible.                                                               |
| **Manual Creation**       | Unlike personal cloud connections, shareable cloud connections need to be created manually in the Power BI service. You can create a new shareable cloud connection directly from the Semantic model settings page under Gateway and cloud connections. Select the shareable cloud connection you want to use and apply it. |

### Creating Shareable Connections

> You can create a new shareable cloud connection directly from the Semantic model settings page under Gateway and cloud connections. Select the shareable cloud connection you want to use and apply it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security: If a data source contains `highly sensitive or confidential data`, set the privacy level to `Private`.

| Privacy level | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Private | Contains sensitive or confidential information, and the visibility of the data source may be restricted to authorized users. It is completely isolated from other data sources. Examples include Facebook data, a text file containing stock awards, or a workbook containing an employee review. |
| Organizational    | Limits the visibility of a data source to a trusted group of people. It is isolated from all Public data sources, but is visible to other Organizational data sources. A common example is a Microsoft Word document on an intranet SharePoint site with permissions enabled for a trusted group. |
| Public | Gives everyone visibility to the data. Only files, internet data sources, or workbook data can be marked Public. Examples include data from a Wikipedia page, or a local file containing data copied from a public web page.|

Steps:

- Go to [Power Bi](https://app.powerbi.com/)
- Click on ⚙️, and go to `Manage connections and gateways`

Some key limitations and considerations regarding reports in the admin monitoring workspace:

| **Category**               | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Non-Modifiable Reports** | - ``Fixed Reports``: Reports in the admin monitoring workspace are often pre-configured and cannot be modified. This means you cannot change the visuals, add new data fields, or customize the layout to fit specific needs.<br/>- ``Limited Customization``: The inability to modify these reports can be restrictive if you need to tailor the data presentation to specific audiences or requirements. |
| **Access and Permissions** | - ``Restricted Access``: Only users with appropriate permissions can view these reports. This can limit the ability of other team members to access and utilize the data.<br/>- ``Data Sensitivity``: Since these reports often contain sensitive administrative data, access controls are crucial to ensure data security and compliance. |

Benefits of sharing the semantic model:

| **Category**               | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creating Custom Reports** | - ``Flexibility``: By sharing the semantic model, users can create their own reports using the same underlying data. This allows for greater flexibility in how data is visualized and analyzed.<br/>- ``Tailored Insights``: Users can customize reports to highlight specific metrics or insights that are most relevant to their needs. |
| **Collaboration**          | - ``Shared Understanding``: Sharing the semantic model promotes a shared understanding of the data across the organization. Different teams can collaborate more effectively by working with the same data definitions and structures.<br/>- ``Enhanced Data Utilization``: Multiple users can leverage the semantic model to create diverse reports, enhancing the overall utilization of the data. |
| **Consistency**            | - ``Standardized Data``: Using a shared semantic model ensures that all reports are based on the same data definitions and calculations, promoting consistency and accuracy in reporting.<br/>- ``Reduced Redundancy``: It reduces the need for multiple versions of the same data, minimizing redundancy and potential discrepancies. |

### On-premises Data Gateways

> On-premises data gateways facilitate secure data transfer between on-premises data sources and Power BI services. They are essential for scenarios `where data cannot be moved to the cloud due to compliance or security reasons`.

| **Category**                     | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ``Restricting Gateway Installations`` | - ``Tenant-Level Control``: Restrict who can install on-premises data gateways at the tenant level through the Power Platform admin center. This prevents unauthorized users from creating new gateway connections.<br/>- ``Role Management``: Assign specific roles to users, such as Admin, Connection Creator, and Connection Creator with Sharing, to control who can create and manage connections on the gateway. |
| ``Security Measures``            | - ``Network Security Groups (NSGs)``: Configure NSGs to allow outbound traffic to necessary endpoints, such as Microsoft Entra ID for authentication and Certificate Authorities for HTTPS connections.<br/>- ``Private Links``: Use private links to secure connectivity from your network to Power BI, ensuring that data traffic does not traverse the public internet.                         |
| ``Managing Data Sources``        | - ``Data Source Configuration``: Configure data sources on the gateway and manage user access to these sources. Ensure that only authorized users can create and manage connections.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ``Monitoring and Auditing``      | - ``Usage Monitoring``: Regularly monitor gateway usage to detect any unauthorized access or unusual activity.<br/>- ``Audit Logs``: Maintain audit logs to track changes and access to the gateways and data sources.                                                                                                                                               |

Steps to Restrict Access for On-Premises Data Gateways:

> - **Tenant-Level Control**: You can `restrict who can install on-premises data gateways at the tenant level through the Power Platform admin center`. This prevents unauthorized users from creating new gateway connections. <br/>
> - **Role Management**: Assign specific roles to users, such as Admin, Connection Creator, and Connection Creator with Sharing, `to control who can create and manage connections on the gateway`.

1. **Access the Power Platform Admin Center**: Go to the [Power Platform Admin Center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/ext/DataGateways).
2. **Navigate to Data Gateways**:
   - Click on **Data** (preview) in the left-hand menu.
   - Select **On-premises data gateway**.
3. **Enable Tenant Administration for Gateways**: Turn on **Tenant administration for gateways**.

### Virtual Network (VNet) Data Gateways

> Allow Power BI to connect to data services within an Azure virtual network without needing an on-premises data gateway. This setup is particularly useful for maintaining security and compliance by keeping data traffic within the Azure backbone.

| **Section**                   | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Licensing Requirements:**| VNet data gateways require a Power BI Premium capacity license (A4 SKU or higher or any P SKU).                                                                                                                                               |
| **Managing VNet Data Gateways:** | - **Admin Management:** You can manage VNet data gateways through the Power Platform admin center or the Manage Gateways page in Power BI.<br/>- **Data Source Management:** Create and share data sources within the VNet data gateway as you would with standard data gateways. |
| **Security and Connectivity:** | - **Private Endpoints:** Use private endpoints to connect securely to your data sources within Azure. This ensures that all traffic remains on the Azure backbone and is not exposed to the public internet.<br/>- **Conditional Access Policies:** VNet data gateways support conditional access policies, allowing you to enforce security measures based on user identity and location.<br/>- **Microsoft Entra ID SSO:** Enable single sign-on (SSO) for DirectQuery to ensure that queries execute under the user's Microsoft Entra ID identity. |
| **Restrictions and Limitations:** | - **Cross-Tenant Scenarios:** VNet data gateways must be created in the same tenant as the Power BI tenant.<br/>- **Region Constraints:** The virtual network data gateway is physically located in the same region as your Azure virtual network. |
