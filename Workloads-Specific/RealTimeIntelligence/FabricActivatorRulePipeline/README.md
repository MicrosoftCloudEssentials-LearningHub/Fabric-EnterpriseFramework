----------

> This process shows how to set up Microsoft Fabric Activator to automate workflows by detecting file creation events in a storage system and triggering another pipeline to run. <br/>
>
> 1. **First Pipeline**: The process starts with a pipeline that ends with a `Copy Data` activity. This activity uploads data into the `Lakehouse`. <br/>
> 2. **Event Stream Setup**: An `Event Stream` is configured in Activator to monitor the Lakehouse for file creation or data upload events. <br/>
> 3. **Triggering the Second Pipeline**: Once the event is detected (e.g., a file is uploaded), the Event Stream triggers the second pipeline to continue the workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> This code generates random data with fields such as id, name, age, email, and created_at, organizes it into a PySpark DataFrame, and saves it to a specified Lakehouse path using the Delta format. Click here to see the [example script](./GeneratesRandomData.ipynb)

## Set Up the First Pipeline

1. **Create the Pipeline**:
   - In [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/), create the first pipeline that performs the required tasks.
   - Add a `Copy Data` activity as the final step in the pipeline.

2. **Generate the Trigger File**:
   - Configure the `Copy Data` activity to create a trigger file in a specific location, such as `Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)` or `OneLake`.
   - Ensure the file name and path are consistent and predictable (e.g., `trigger_file.json` in a specific folder).
3. **Publish and Test**: Publish the pipeline and test it to ensure the trigger file is created successfully.

## Configure Activator to Detect the Event

> [!TIP]
> Event options:

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/282fae9b-e1c6-490d-bd23-9ed9bdf6105d>

1. **Set Up an Event**:
   - Create a new event to monitor the location where the trigger file is created (e.g., ADLS or OneLake). Click on `Real-Time`:

   - Choose the appropriate event type, such as `File Created`.

   - Add a source:

2. **Test Event Detection**:
   - Save the event and test it by manually running the first pipeline to ensure Activator detects the file creation.
   - Check the **Event Details** screen in Activator to confirm the event is logged.

## Set Up the Second Pipeline

1. **Create the Pipeline**:
   - In Microsoft Fabric, create the second pipeline that performs the next set of tasks.
   - Ensure it is configured to accept external triggers.
2. **Publish the Pipeline**: Publish the second pipeline and ensure it is ready to be triggered.

## Define the Rule in Activator

1. **Setup the Activator**:

   <https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c88e080-d5aa-4920-acd6-94c2e4ae0568>

2. **Create a New Rule**:
   - In `Activator`, create a rule that responds to the event you just configured.
   - Set the condition to match the event details (e.g., file name, path, or metadata).
3. **Set the Action**:
   - Configure the rule to trigger the second pipeline.
   - Specify the pipeline name and pass any required parameters.
3. **Save and Activate**:
   - Save the rule and activate it.
   - Ensure the rule is enabled and ready to respond to the event.

## Test the Entire Workflow

1. **Run the First Pipeline**: Execute the first pipeline and verify that the trigger file is created.
2. **Monitor Activator**: Check the `Event Details` and `Rule Activation Details` in Activator to ensure the event is detected and the rule is activated.
3. **Verify the Second Pipeline**: Confirm that the second pipeline is triggered and runs successfully.

## Troubleshooting (If Needed)

- If the second pipeline does not trigger:
  1. Double-check the rule configuration in Activator.
  2. Review the logs in Activator for any errors or warnings.
