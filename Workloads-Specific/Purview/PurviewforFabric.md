## Purview + Fabric 

> Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Fabric are integrated to provide a comprehensive `data governance and analytics platform`.
> Purview enables users to `discover, classify, and protect data within Fabric`, ensuring that `data governance policies are consistently applied across the entire data estate`.
> Purview's capabilities, such as `automated scanning, ingestion, classification, and sensitivity labeling, enhance the governance of Fabric's data assets, providing a unified approach to data management and compliance`.

## Microsoft Purview Pricing: Fabric focused

> When Purview is integrated with Fabric, the following aspects are considered for pricing:

    A[Data Map] --> B[Storage]
    A --> C[Operations]
    D[Data Catalog] --> E[Storage]
    D --> F[Operations]
    G[Information Protection] --> H[Sensitivity Labels]
    G --> I[DLP]

    B --> J[Charged by metadata amount]
    C --> K[Charged by operations]
    E --> L[Charged by metadata amount]
    F --> M[Charged by operations]
    H --> N[Charged by protected assets]
    I --> O[Charged by policies and data volume]
```

> [!TIP]
> `Compute resources` are used for `operations` such as scanning, ingestion, classification, enrichment, and report generation. These operations involve processing data and performing various tasks that require computational power. <br/> 
> `Storage resources` are used to `store metadata`, data maps, and other related information. This includes the storage of scanned metadata, enriched metadata, and generated reports. 

| Aspect | Description | Pricing |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Unified Data Catalog** | **Metadata Management**: Purview captures metadata from Fabric items. | Cost is based on the amount of metadata stored and the operations performed. |
| **Information Protection** | **Sensitivity Labels**: Applying sensitivity labels to Fabric items. | Charges are based on the number of assets protected. |
| **Data Governance** | **Data Map Operations**: Scanning and cataloging Fabric data assets in Purview. | Charged based on the number of operations performed. |

> Pricing example: <br/> 
>
> 1. **Automated Scanning, Ingestion & Classification**: **Other data sources**: 0.5 minutes of total scan duration using 16 vCores. <br/> 
> 2. **Data Map Enrichment**: 365 hours of advanced resource set usage. <br/> 
> 3. **Report Generation**: 365 hours of report generation. <br/>
> 4. **Elastic Data Map**: 1 capacity units used for 365 hours. `1 Capacity Unit supports requests of up to 25 data map operations per second and includes storage of up to 10 GB of metadata about data assets` <br/>  
> 5. **Data Catalog**: Included with the Data Map. <br/> 
> 6. **Data Policy**: 0 DevOps policies applied. <br/> 
> 7. **Insights Consumption**: 0 API calls.

> [!NOTE]
> Viewing reports generated by Microsoft Purview within Microsoft Fabric does not incur additional charges. The costs are primarily associated with the generation of the reports, which involves processing and computing resources. Once the reports are generated, viewing them is typically free of charge.

## Cost Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Details |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Efficient Scanning and Classification** | Optimize scanning and classification processes to reduce costs. | - **Schedule Scans**: Schedule scans during off-peak hours to reduce costs associated with high-demand periods.<br> - **Incremental Scans**: Use incremental scans to only scan new or modified data, reducing the total scan duration and vCore usage. |
| **Selective Data Map Enrichment** | Focus on enriching metadata for critical data assets. | - **Prioritize Critical Data**: Focus on enriching metadata for critical data assets that require detailed governance and analysis.<br> - **Batch Processing**: Process data in batches to optimize resource usage and reduce vCore-hour costs. |
| **Targeted Report Generation** | Limit report generation to essential reports. | - **Generate Essential Reports**: Limit report generation to essential reports that provide the most value for decision-making and compliance monitoring.<br> - **Optimize Report Frequency**: Adjust the frequency of report generation to balance between timely insights and cost efficiency. |
| **Elastic Data Map Utilization** | Efficiently manage capacity units to optimize costs. | - **Monitor Usage**: Regularly monitor capacity unit usage to ensure efficient allocation and avoid over-provisioning.<br> - **Scale Appropriately**: Scale capacity units based on actual usage patterns to optimize costs. |
| **API Call Management** | Minimize unnecessary API calls to reduce costs. | - **Optimize API Usage**: Minimize unnecessary API calls by caching results and reusing data where possible.<br> - **Batch API Requests**: Group API requests to reduce the number of individual calls, optimizing cost per API call. |
