## Admin monitoring

> `Admin monitoring workspace` in Microsoft Fabric is a powerful tool for administrators to track and analyze usage metrics across their organization. This workspace provides detailed insights into how different features and services are being utilized, helping admins make informed decisions to optimize performance and resource allocation.

Key Components:

| **Item**                          | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Feature Usage and Adoption - Report** | Provides detailed reports on the adoption and usage of various features within the organization. |
| **Feature Usage and Adoption - Semantic model** | Contains the underlying data model that supports the usage and adoption reports. |
| **Purview Hub - Semantic model**  | Includes data models related to data governance and compliance monitoring.      |
| **Purview Hub - Report**          | Offers reports on data governance and compliance, helping to ensure adherence to relevant regulations and standards. |

Benefits of Using Admin Monitoring Workspace:

1. **Track Feature Adoption**: Understand which features are being used the most and identify areas where additional training or resources might be needed.
2. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on system performance and identify any bottlenecks or issues that need to be addressed.
3. **Optimize Resources**: Make data-driven decisions about scaling and resource allocation to ensure optimal performance.
4. **Ensure Compliance**: Use the Purview Hub to monitor data governance and compliance, ensuring that your organization adheres to relevant regulations and standards.

### Configure the Admin Monitoring Workspace

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - **Permissions**: `Only users with direct admin roles can set up the Admin Monitoring workspace`. If the admin role `is assigned through a group, data refreshes may fail`. <br/>
> - **Read-Only Workspace**: The `Admin Monitoring workspace is read-only`. Users, including admins, cannot edit or view properties of items such as semantic models and reports within the workspace. `Admins can share reports and semantic models within the workspace with other users by assigning them a workspace viewer role or providing direct access links.`
> - **Reinitializing the Workspace**: If needed, `you can reinitialize the workspace by executing an API call to delete the semantic model and then reinstalling the workspace`.

1. **Log into Microsoft Fabric**: Sign in to the [Microsoft Fabric service](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) with your admin credentials.
2. **Access the Admin Portal**:
   - Click on the **Settings** gear icon in the top right corner.
   - Select **Admin Portal** from the dropdown menu.

        <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/642655d2-54c6-40ff-8060-7ed533e6ad57">

3. **Navigate to the Admin Monitoring Workspace**:
   - In the Admin Portal, you will see a message about the new monitoring and metrics experience under `Usage Metrics`:
   - Click on the **Open admin monitoring workspace** link provided in the message.

        <img width="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573e6ccc-ac22-4ed4-9520-5f132400b9c8">

4. **Install the Workspace**:
   - If this is your first time accessing the Admin Monitoring workspace, it will automatically begin the installation process.
   - Wait a few minutes for the installation to complete. The initial data refresh will start around five minutes after installation and usually completes within a few minutes.

5. **Configure Data Refresh**:
   - The semantic models in the workspace are automatically refreshed once per day.
   - Ensure that the admin who first accessed the workspace remains an admin to maintain the scheduled refresh process.

6. **Reassign Workspace (Optional)**:
   - To take advantage of capacity benefits such as unlimited content sharing, you can reassign the workspace to a different license mode:
     - Navigate to the **Workspaces** page in the Admin Portal.
     - Select the **Actions** button next to the Admin Monitoring workspace.
     - Choose **Reassign workspace** and select the desired license mode, then click **Save**.

## Monitor Hub

> Centralized tool that allows `users to view and track the status of activities across all workspaces for which they have permissions`. This hub provides a comprehensive overview of various `activities, such as dataset refreshes, Spark job runs, dataflows, datamarts, lakehouses, notebooks, semantic models, report views, etc`.

| **Feature**             | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Activity Tracking**   | Displays activities for all Fabric items you have permission to view, sorted by start time with the newest activities at the top. |
| **Historical View**     | Keeps a history of activities for up to 30 days, allowing you to view past activities using the Historical runs option. |
| **Customizable Display**| Allows you to change the display order, configure table columns, and use keyword search and filters to find specific activities. |
| **Status and Details**  | Provides detailed status information for each activity, including the ability to view more details and take actions if you have the right permissions. |
| **Filter Options**      | You can filter activities by status, start time, item type, submitted by, and location to narrow down the results. |

### How to Access and Use the Monitor Hub

1. **Open the Monitor Hub**: In [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/), select **Monitor** from the navigation pane. If you don't see it click on `...`:

>
> - Provides extended audit log retention up to 1 year with appropriate licensing. <br>
> - Use the Purview portal to view and export detailed activity logs. <br>
> - Utilize the Purview REST API to access scan history beyond 30 days.

Steps to  Access Microsoft Purview via Audit Logs:

1. **Navigate to the Admin Portal**:
   - Go to the [Microsoft Fabric](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) and sign in with your admin account.
   - Click on the **Settings** gear icon and select **Admin Portal**.
