- If you choose to use a Terraform approach, please ensure that:
  - [Terraform is installed on your local machine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/install-cli#install-terraform).
  - [Install the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to work with both Terraform and Azure commands.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

> Is crucial for modern cloud-based solutions and applications. Here is why:

<details>
<summary>1. Consistency and Reproducibility</summary>

- **Consistent Environments**: IaC ensures that your development, testing, and production environments are consistent. `This reduces the it works on my machine problem` and ensures that applications run reliably across different environments.
- **Reproducibility**: With IaC, you can `recreate your infrastructure from scratch in a consistent manner.` This is particularly useful for `disaster recovery and scaling`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Version Control</summary>

- **Source Control**: By storing IaC configurations in version control systems like GitHub, you `can track changes, collaborate with team members, and roll back to previous versions if needed.`
- **Change Management**: Version control `provides a history of changes, making it easier to understand what changes were made, who made them, and why.`

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Flexibility and IaC tools Options</summary>

> Microsoft provides several IaC tools, including Terraform, Bicep, and ARM templates. Each tool offers different features and benefits, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

- **Terraform**: A popular IaC tool that uses a high-level configuration language to define and provision infrastructure. It `supports multiple cloud providers, making it a versatile choice.`
- **Bicep**: A domain-specific language that uses declarative syntax to deploy Azure resources. It offers a `concise and easy-to-read alternative to JSON-based ARM templates.`
- **ARM Templates**: JSON files that`define the infrastructure and configuration for your Azure solution.` They provide a detailed and flexible way to manage Azure resources.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Enhanced Security</summary>

- **Automated Security Policies**: IaC allows you to `define and enforce security policies automatically.` This ensures that security best practices are `consistently applied across all environments.`
- **Compliance**: IaC helps maintain compliance with `regulatory requirements by providing a clear and auditable trail of infrastructure changes.`

</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Scalability</summary>

- **Dynamic Scaling**: IaC enables `dynamic scaling of resources based on demand.` This ensures that your infrastructure can handle varying workloads efficiently.
- **Resource Optimization**: By automating the `provisioning and de-provisioning of resources,` IaC helps optimize resource usage and reduce costs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Automation</summary>

- **Automated Provisioning**: IaC allows you to `automate the provisioning of infrastructure. This reduces manual errors, speeds up deployments, and ensures that infrastructure changes are applied consistently.`
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrating IaC with `Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automates the deployment process, ensuring that infrastructure changes are tested and deployed alongside application code.`

</details>

## Microsoft Purview for Fabric

> **Microsoft Purview** is a unified data governance solution that helps `organizations manage and govern` their on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) data. When integrated with **Microsoft Fabric**, Purview enhances `data discovery, classification, lineage, and access control` across the entire data estate. In the context of **Microsoft Fabric**, which is an end-to-end analytics platform that unifies data engineering, data science, real-time analytics, and business intelligence, Purview plays a crucial role in:

- **Data Cataloging**: Automatically scanning and cataloging data assets across Fabric workspaces.
- **Data Lineage**: Tracking how data flows and transforms across pipelines, notebooks, and reports.
- **Access Management**: Enforcing data access policies and ensuring compliance.
- **Data Classification**: Identifying sensitive data using built-in or custom classifiers.

> When to Integrate Purview with Fabric?

1. **You need centralized data governance** across multiple data sources and services within Fabric.
2. **Compliance and regulatory requirements** demand visibility into data usage, classification, and lineage.
3. **Your organization handles sensitive data** (e.g., PII, financial data) and needs automated classification and protection.
4. **You want to empower data consumers** (analysts, scientists, engineers) to discover and understand data assets easily.
5. **You are scaling your data operations** and need consistent governance policies across teams and projects.
